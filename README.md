Salpakan - Game of the Generals (Under Development)

Salpakan (also known as *Game of the Generals*) is a strategy board game designed for two players. 
Each player commands an army, aiming to capture their opponent's flag while strategically eliminating opposing pieces. 
The game is unique in that it involves an arbiter (a computer in this version) that secretly adjudicates the interactions between pieces without revealing their ranks.

Features
- Two-Player Mode: Players alternate turns, moving one piece at a time across the board.
- Rank-Based Combat: Each piece has a rank, and the pieces can eliminate each other based on a hierarchy of ranks.
- Computer Arbiter: The game includes an automated arbiter that adjudicates conflicts between pieces without revealing their ranks to the other player.
- Drag and Drop: Interactive, drag-and-drop functionality for moving pieces on the board.
- Responsive Design: The game board adapts to different screen sizes for seamless gameplay on both desktop and mobile devices.

Gameplay Mechanics
- Objective: The goal is to capture your opponent's flag or to successfully move your flag to the other side of the board.
- Pieces and Ranks:
  - The pieces are divided into different ranks. Higher-ranking pieces can eliminate lower-ranking ones, except for special rules (e.g., spies can eliminate generals).
  - Each player has one flag that must be protected.
- Movement: Players take turns moving one piece per turn, either horizontally or vertically on the board.
- Combat: When two pieces meet, the arbiter (computer) determines which piece is eliminated based on their hidden ranks.
  
 echnologies Used
- HTML5: For structuring the game interface.
- CSS3: For styling and creating a visually appealing board and pieces.
- JavaScript: For game logic, including movement, turn-based gameplay, and the arbiter functionality.
  
Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/salpakan.git
   ```
2. Open `index.html` in your web browser to start playing.

How to Play

1. Each player starts by secretly arranging their pieces on their side of the board.
2. Players take turns selecting a piece and dragging it to an adjacent space (horizontally or vertically).
3. If a player's piece moves into a space occupied by an opposing piece, the computer arbiter decides which piece is removed from the board, without revealing the pieces' ranks to the players.
4. The game continues until one player's flag is captured or moved successfully to the opponent’s side.

Future Improvements
- AI Opponent: Implementing a single-player mode with an AI opponent.
- Sound Effects: Adding sound effects for piece movement and combat.
- Save and Load Game: The ability to save and resume games.
- Online Multiplayer: Expanding the game for online play between remote players.
